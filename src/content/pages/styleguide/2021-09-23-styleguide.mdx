## What is this?

The purpose of this guide is to have something to which I can refer when making design choices for tools and visualizations. All rules are made to be broken, but they're also made to make decisions easier along the way.

## The Basics

The tax·plot branding language is a goofy version of midcentury modern design. Retro-futurism in the Archer vein is my hoped-for aesthetic. This basically boils down to me wanting everything to display a quality design of the 1960's with enough modern elements to catch attention encourage engagement.

## Name and Logo

taxplot is lower case.

tax·plot should be written with the middle dot where appropriate.

taxplot.com is a thing and tax·plot is a thing, but tax·plot.com is NOT a thing.

<span style="font-family:monospace">tax·plot</span> should be written in plain monospace
where possible.
<br/>
<br/>
The logo itself is just <span style="font-family:monospace">
tax·plot

</span> written large enough to stand out as a logo:
<br />
<span style="font-family:monospace; font-size:3em">tax·plot</span>

The logo should be written in black or as part of a composition made up of colors in the palettes discussed below.

## Colors

The main colors for <span style="font-family:monospace">tax·plot</span> content appear below. Click on any box to copy its color hex code to the clipboard.

<ColorContainer palette={mainPalette} />
<br />

Sometimes I'll use more 'crazy' colors from the time (I definitely didn't steal these from the Archer closing credits). Again, click on any box to copy its color hex code to the clipboard.

<ColorContainer palette={wildPalette} />
