import { GovMap } from './GovSalaryMap/GovMap';

You'd have to really stretch to pretend that this has anything to do with tax planning, but I thought of looking into this in the shower this morning and seeing as how I put the visualization together and everything, I figured I might as well post it.

  State Governor Salaries as a Multiple of that State's Median Household Income

It sure would be interesting to know what's going on in Maine and Tennessee.

Governor salary data comes from the [Council of State Governments - The Book of the States Vol 52](https://issuu.com/csg.publications/docs/bos_2020_web).

Household income data comes from [FRED, a database of economic data maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=259515&rid=249)
