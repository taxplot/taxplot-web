Sometimes people move from one state to another, and sometimes those people own businesses. The question that often comes up is whether the business can move with its owner. The answer is almost alway "yes", but there's a caveat that sometimes it's a breeze to move your business to a new state, and sometimes it's a nightmare.

<h2>It's almost always a breeze for sole proprietors</h2>

For sole proprietors -- those whose business income and expenses are reported on Schedule C of their personal tax return and who do not have an LLC or other separate legal entity -- moving is easy. Since an owner and her sole proprietorship are one and the same, the business lives where the owner lives. A move may require a new business license and fictitious name registration, updates to insurance policies and bank accounts, but for the most part there isn't much that needs to be done. Things only get more complicated when separate legal entities are involved.

<h2>Domestication and Redomestication</h2>

When a small buisiness is conducted via a legal entity entity separate from its owner, moving can get a little more hairy. Since legal entities are formed at the state level, keeping the same entity through the move to a new state will require both the state of origin and the state of destination to allow the transfer. This is called "redomestication". About 29 states have laws that allow for at least some form of redomestication, so if a business owner is lucky enough to be moving from one of these states to another of these states, and if the type of business entity falls in line with the domestication laws of both states, then transferring the entity will only be a matter of paperwork.

In cases where the business in question does not qualify for redomestication in one or both of the relevant jurisdictions, there may be some additional hoops to jump through for the owner to get the entity transferred. For example, while California allows for the incoming domestication of any type of business entity, it only allows for the outgoing redomestication of non-corporate entites. Thus, a California business that seeks to move to Florida (a popular scenario in my recent experience) will have smoothe sailing so long as it's organized as an LLC or partnership, but will have to take additional steps if it happens to be a corporation. In this particular case, it is often possible to convert the California corporation to a California LLC before redomesticating it to a Florida LLC and then converting back to a corporation. As with anything involving multi-jurisdictional business law, there are plenty of exceptions and everything can change if we choose different jurisdictions.

<h2>Sometimes you just can't redomesticate</h2>

Where one or both jurisdictions disallows redomestication of a particular business, there are still options to allow the owner to continue to do business from her new home. Most simply, she can keep the business entity in its original jurisdiction and register it as a "foreign" entity allowed to do business in the new state. This can be a bit of an ongoing headache since there will be annual compliance requirements and fees in two states instead of one, but in most cases the increased burden is not a deal-breaker. Where this is not desirable, the owner has many options for terminating or liquidating the old entity and transferring its assets to a brand new entity in the new state. The new entity will carry on with the same name, business model, assets, etc. as the old entity, but will need to go through the same start-up headaches as any other new business (ex. new bank accounts, tax ID numbers, etc.)

But, even in the worst-case scenario, the answer to the question "can I take my business when I move?" will almost always be "yes!". It's just that sometimes you'll have to pay your lawyers more than you had hoped.
